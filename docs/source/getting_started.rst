Getting Started
===============

This section describes how to start using WPHP once it has been set up.

Home Page
=========

The home page is the first thing a user will see when opening the WPHP site. It provides a starting point for engaging with the content of WPHP.

Random Entries
--------------

Each time the home page is loaded, it will display five random entries for each of the three main content types: titles, persons, and firms.

Recent Announcements
--------------------

The home page will display the excerpt for the five most recent blog posts. Each excerpt includes the title of the blog post, the excerpt, the time posted, the posting user, and the blog post category.

Search
======

Each of the three main content types have their own search page with individual features and filters. They are accessible from the main menu or via a button in the upper righthand side of each content type's browse page.

Browse
======

The browse pages show a complete list for all entries in the collection separated by content type (:ref:`title <titles>`, :ref:`person <persons>`, or :ref:`firm <firms>`). The search page for each content type is also accessible from the **search** button at the top of the page.

A quick search and *Jump to ID* field is available from the **search** button in the upper righthand side of each content type's browse page. 

Each :ref:`title <titles>`, :ref:`person <persons>`, and :ref:`firm <firms>` entry are assigned a unique ID. If you know an entry's ID, it can be accessed directly via the *Jump to ID* input field. A quick search for each content type is available here.
